Notes:-
    => AVL Tree Data Structure.

        ->What is AVL Tree?
            -> Height balanced binary search trees.
            -> Height difference between heights of the left and right subtrees for every nodes is less than or equal to 1.
            -> Balanced factor= Height of right subtree - Height of left subtree.
            -> Balance factor Can be -1, 0 or 1 for a node to be balanced in a Binary search tree.
            -> Balance factor can be -1, 0 or 1 for all nodes of an AVL tree.

        -> Why do we need an AVL Tree?
            -> Almost all the operations in a binary search tree are of order O(h) where h is the height of the tree.
            -> If we don't plan our tree properly, this height can get as high as n where n is the number of nodes in a BST(skewed tree).
            -> To guarantee and upper bound of O(log n) for all these operations, we use balanced tree.


        => Rotation in AVL Trees
            
            -> LL rotations in an AVL Tree
            -> RR rotations in an AVL Tree
            -> LR rotations in an AVL Tree
            -> RL rotations in an AVL Tree
